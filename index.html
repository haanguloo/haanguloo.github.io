										<h2>About Me</h2>
										<p>Hey, I am a software engineer<br />
										who can help you out to design,<br />
										build, and operate an AI/ML driven solution.</p>
									</header>
									<p>I am a computer science enthusiast, who is actively using software/hardware to the problem-solving domain. I have set of areas of interest that include (but are not limited to by any means) Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, Data Science, Statistics, Math, Neuroscience, Psychology, Education, among others. My goal is to bring technology to different areas to fundamentally enable a better future.</p>

									<h3>Areas of Interest</h3>
									<p>Identifying the problem and its restrictions is the first step to map out the tools and technologies can be used as potential candidates for a solution. In addition, learning as much as possible about the context in which the solution is going to be applied, provides important insights that I take into account to shape a solution. For that reason, it is fundamental to have a constant communication channel to identify potential drawbacks and have a continuous feedback from the stakeholders and the end-users.</p>

												<h4>Artificial Intelligence</h4>
												<p>Over the past 5 years, AI has experienced an acceleration that previously was just a dream. Now, with the creation of proper hardware such as GPU and TPU, the process has been simplified significantly, and that is an area that I really like to apply in the solutions when I consider appropriate.</p>

												<h4>Software Engineering</h4>
												<p>Engineering a solution is more than defining the steps of the SDLC. I do believe that it requires time and a lot of thinking because the design usually defines how a product can potentially be expanded. This is an area that I consider really fundamental to practice and reflect on every single project that I am involved in.</p>

											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Data Science</h4>
												<p>This is potentially one of the most eye-opening and satisfying areas of knowledge that combines different fields such as CS, ML, Statistics, Math, Logic, and Intuitive Reasoning. I do consider that it provides a great set of googles to discover what is behind a certain problem, and shapes what you want to do next.</p>

												<h4>Cybersecurity</h4>
												<p>This is an area that I have been practicing since 2014. I have been involved in projects that helped me understand the importance of of security in the context of technology. That is also an aspect that is present in all the projects that I work. This is a fundamental area that should never be neglected! That is why I prefer to use Secure SDLC rather than the standard SDLC. In addition, I combine it with best practices from the OWASP framework!</p>
